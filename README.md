#DESCRIPTION:This project implements a real-time multithreaded chat application using Java Sockets. The system follows a client–server architecture, where a central server handles multiple clients at the same time using multithreading.
The server continuously listens for client connections. When a client joins, the server creates a separate thread to handle that client's messages. This allows many users to chat simultaneously without interruption.
The client program connects to the server using a socket. Users can type messages, which are sent to the server. The server then broadcasts these messages to all connected clients, enabling group chat functionality.
Deliverable:
A fully functional multithreaded client-server chat application that supports:
Multiple client connections
Real-time messaging
Message broadcasting
Thread handling per client

This project demonstrates knowledge of sockets, networking, threads, and inter-process 
communication.
